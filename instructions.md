# DDNS Updater instructions

Configure one or more of the supported DNS providers by pasting the correct JSON string into the 'DDNS Provider(s)' setting.

A list of DNS providers and their JSON configuration can be found here: [DDNS Updater provider documentation](https://github.com/qdm12/ddns-updater/tree/master/docs)

Once configured, start the service and inspect the logs to verify that it started successfully and that the DNS updates were successful.
